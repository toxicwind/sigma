// Exit-enumeration matrix (#588): every wire exit x cross-cutting concern
// must have an explicit cell here. `Record<WireExitId, ExitCell>` is the
// compile-time guard — adding an exit to WIRE_EXITS without filling its row
// in EVERY concern table fails typecheck. `implementer` holds live symbol
// references (moving/deleting an implementation breaks the import), and
// `coveredBy` names the test file(s) asserting the cell's contract — the
// matrix test (tests/wire-exit-matrix.test.ts) fails if a listed file is
// missing, and behavior tests iterate WIRE_EXITS so a new exit with no
// scenario coverage fails the run. This is a registry only: no runtime
// behavior is routed through it.
