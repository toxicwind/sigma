/** Upstream transport failure taxonomy (#1263).
 *
 *  Field diagnosis of long-session failures (omp → bili → external proxy →
 *  upstream) was blind because every network error surfaced as a flattened
 *  `code=/message=` blob: a proxy that recycles the socket mid-CONNECT, an
 *  upstream that goes silent past the idle budget, and a client disconnect
 *  are three different remedies, but were indistinguishable in the log. This
 *  module owns the ONE classification used everywhere (fetchWithRetry's
 *  replay decision, formatUpstreamError's log prefix, the status snapshot).
 *
 *  Kept dependency-free and below both fetch-util and upstream-proxy so
 *  neither imports the other just for this (they already form an import
 *  edge upstream-proxy → fetch-util; adding the reverse would be a cycle). */
