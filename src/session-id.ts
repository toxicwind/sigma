 * Session identity for the proxy's OWN compression state.

 * The session ID is the client-provided conversation value VERBATIM — no hash,
 * no other dimensions. The client explicitly states which conversation this
 * is (codex `session-id`/`thread-id`, claude `x-claude-code-session-id`,
 * opencode `x-opencode-session`, Responses body `session_id` /
 * `metadata.session_id`, `prompt_cache_key`, ...), and that value is the only
 * invariant that actually binds to the conversation. Everything else is
 * mutable mid-conversation and must not break session continuity (#280, #286):
 * credentials rotate (ChatGPT OAuth bearers), users switch relays/upstreams,
 * and the wire protocol itself can change (relay translation, cross-protocol
 * model switches).
 *
 * A protocol switch is safe under one id because session state is
 * protocol-neutral (kernel-normalized CompressionState, text block contents,
 * CoreMessage snapshots) and the client re-sends the full history every turn,
 * where the current protocol's adapter re-normalizes it.
 *
 * Requests WITHOUT a client-provided identity are rejected with 400 by the
 * server: the content-fingerprint fallback has a real collision surface and
 * would silently orphan state, so anonymous requests fail explicitly instead.
 *
 * The id is used ONLY inside the proxy (compression-state store, persistence,
 * UI label). It is NEVER sent upstream — if a per-conversation signal is
 * needed for upstream routing, use `affinityToken()` below.

/** #1106/#1102: whether the Responses-wire instructions fingerprint should
 *  participate in the compression-session key at all. Inverted allowlist: the
 *  fingerprint is OFF by default and applies ONLY to signals with a verified
 *  id-sharing persona problem.
 *
 * subagentNamespace's instructions fingerprint exists to separate PERSONAS that
 *  share one conversation id. Exactly two defendants ever needed it:
 *  - codex (#150): task-level session ids are REUSED across tasks, so
 *    different task instructions under one id must not merge. Modern codex
 *    (>=0.147) already isolates subagent threads via x-codex-turn-metadata ->
 *    thread-id verbatim (server.ts keys those directly, bypassing this
 *    predicate); the fingerprint still matters for root threads and older
 *    codex builds, detected by the turn-metadata header or the user agent
 *    (same convention as isCodexClient, #645).
 *  - claude over Responses (#970): subagents SHARE the main agent's session
 *    id (the Anthropic path splits them via claudeSubagentSplit; a claude
 *    client on the Responses wire only has this fingerprint).
 *
 * Everyone else keys VERBATIM: instructions drift mid-id means "same
 * conversation, evolved system context" (software upgrade, plugin install,
 * AGENTS.md edit - the relay-station majority case, #1106), and forking there
 * resets all compression state for no defending bug. opencode (persona-scoped
 * ses_ ids, #1102/#1104), grok/mcode (per-session ids by their own source),
 * plugin conversation ids, and generic x-session-id / body session_id all
 * stay on the verbatim path now. The x-sigma-plugin-instructions-mutable
 * declaration (#1104) is vestigial: exempt is the default; hosts keep
 * stamping it for protocol compatibility with older proxies.
 *
 * A future client that shares one id across personas and separates them ONLY
 * by instructions must be added here (same evidence-per-client discipline as
 * #1104, inverted).

 * for spawned agent threads) and `thread_id`. Subagent threads REUSE the

 * of one task onto a single session — subagents inherit the root's
 * compression state, which breaks #150's isolation (a guardian subagent must
 * read the user's original authorization verbatim, never a compressed
 * summary).
 *
 * When the metadata is present AND cross-checked (metadata.thread_id ===
 * `thread-id` header), partition by thread_source:
 *   - "user"     → undefined (validated, but the id resolves through the
 *                  legacy precedence chain — binding the session-id header
 *                  directly would leapfrog stronger headers such as
 *                  x-sigma-plugin-conversation and flip the identity when a

 *                  chain reads the same session-id header for plain codex

 *   - anything else → the `thread-id` header (fresh independent state per
 *                  thread; self-contained replay is lossless). codex's
 *                  ThreadSource serializes more than user/subagent —
 *                  "guardian_review" (review sessions), "memory_consolidation",
 *                  and arbitrary Feature strings such as "guardian_classifier"
 *                  (guardian-v2 async scorer) — all of which are internal
 *                  threads that need #150 isolation just as much, so the
 *                  discrimination is inverted: only "user" joins the root
 *                  session, every other source gets its own thread state.

/**
 * Claude Code subagent split (#970).
 *
 * Claude Code stamps the SAME `x-claude-code-session-id` on every model
 * request of a session — including requests made by Task-tool subagents —
 * so the identity chain maps main turn and all subagents onto ONE session.
 * Every request then serializes on that session's lock (withSessionLock
 * covers prepare + forward + the streamed response), and a slow subagent
 * first request head-of-line-blocks the main turn (and vice versa) for the
 * full upstream latency.
 *
 * Discrimination is two-signal, both verified against live Claude Code
 * 2.1.274 traffic (`-p` mode AND custom agent types like Explore):
 *
 * 1. HEADER: the request carries `x-claude-code-agent-id` and/or
 *    `x-claude-code-parent-agent-id`. Main-turn requests carry agent-id only
 *    from their second request on (the very first request and side requests
 *    like title generation carry neither), so the header alone can't decide —
 *    the parent header is NOT reliable (general-purpose `-p` subagents send
 *    it, custom agent types like Explore do not).
 *
 * 2. SYSTEM: the MAIN agent's system always contains a block starting with
 *    one of the MAIN_SYSTEM_PREFIXES ("You are Claude Code…" for interactive
 *    sessions, "You are an interactive agent…" for -p/SDK sessions), while a
 *    subagent's system blocks are its agent definition ("This session is a
 *    background job…", "You are a file search specialist for…", …) — no
 *    stable positive marker exists across agent types, so the check is
 *    negative: none of the main prefixes may match.
 *
 * A request splits only when BOTH signals say subagent (header present AND
 * no main prefix in system). Failure modes degrade in the safe direction:
 * if a future Claude Code rewords its main prompts, subagents stop being
 * split (back to today's serial behavior) — the main session can never be
 * mis-split, because its prefixes are the gate and its system legitimately
 * mutates turn to turn without ever losing the prefix block.
 *
 * Split sessions keep per-subagent compression state (a subagent is its own
 * conversation; isolation matches the codex #316/#150 semantics) and get
 * their own lock chain, so subagents stop queueing behind the main turn.
 * The namespace format mirrors subagentNamespace's `<id>|sub:<hash>` on the
 * Responses branch. Clients without these headers (older Claude Code, other
 * agents, curl) are untouched.
