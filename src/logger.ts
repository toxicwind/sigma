/**
 * Tee logger: writes every log line to BOTH a file (append, default
 * ~/.local/state/sigma/sigma.log) and stderr (so a foreground `sigma`
 * still shows output in the terminal).
 *
 * A single WriteStream is held open for the life of the process (opening the
 * file once, not per line). The hazards this exposes are handled explicitly:
 *   - If the underlying file is renamed/replaced (our own 10MB rotation,
 *     logrotate, a manual rename), the held fd becomes an orphan inode and
 *     writes silently drift to the renamed file — no 'error' event fires
 *     because the fd is still valid. We detect this on every write by
 *     comparing the fd's inode (fstat) with the current path's inode (stat)
 *     and reopen against the current path when they diverge.
 *   - If a (re)open fails (disk full, perms, path clobbered), logging degrades
 *     to stderr-only with a single [warn] instead of crashing the proxy.
 *   - If stderr's reader is gone (broken pipe), the write fails — synchronously
 *     on Windows, but on Linux stderr over a pipe is an async stream and EPIPE
 *     arrives as an 'error' EVENT that a try/catch around write() can never see.
 *     A module-init listener flips logging to file-only on the first failure;
 *     without it the event rethrows as uncaughtException, the top-level handler
 *     logs it through this very writer, and the feedback loop spams the log
 *     file until rotation wipes the forensic window (#1233).
 *
 * Line format: `<iso-ts> [level][ [sess=<session-id>]] [v=<version>] <msg>`
 * — one prefix per PHYSICAL line (multi-line payloads repeat ts+level+tags on
 * every row, which is what makes line-wise grep / time-window queries honest).
 * The [sess=...] token is request-scoped via AsyncLocalStorage — see
 * enterSessionContext() below; the [v=...] token is process-wide (the running
 * build's version), so any single line from a multi-instance shared log file
 * self-identifies its writer even when different versions coexist.
 *
 * Before hitting file/stderr every line passes redactSecretsInText() (#1718)
 * — a final scrub for credential-shaped tokens in free-form text (upstream
 * error bodies echoing API keys), complementing per-call-site structural
 * masking in log-mask.ts. The programmatic capture hook receives the raw
 * message: it is an in-process test/diagnostic seam, not a log surface.
