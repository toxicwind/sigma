// Streaming-safe stripper for model-emitted literal ACP render tags (#206).
// Compressed history is rendered to the model as render tags; models sometimes
// imitate them in visible output ("tag echo"), the client replays the echoed
// tags on later turns, and the imitation amplifies into unbounded repetition.
// Stripping render tags from outgoing text breaks the loop at the source.
//
// The imitation has two shapes. The plain one is a copy of the rendered form
// (an opening with its attributes, a ref inside, a close); the wrapped one puts
// the model's whole turn, its tool call included, where the opening's
// attributes are still open, so no close is ever written and regex matching
// alone cannot see the span (see BROKEN_ATTRS, SWALLOW_CAP). Both end the same
// way: the span is swallowed, never handed to the client as orphan markup.
// ONLY the render form (\x3c<name> attrs…\x3e, \x3c<name …/\x3e, \x3c/<name>\x3e) is stripped —
// the underscore-namespaced text-protocol triggers (\x3cacp_compress\x3e etc.) and
// ordinary prose containing \x3c pass through untouched.
// #673: models typo the 3-letter name when imitating (observed: acip/acpi,
// including mixed correct-open + typo'd-close), so <name> matches a bounded
// mutation set instead of the exact spelling: the three core letters in any
// order, plus at most ONE extra letter drawn from that set or an inserted i.
// Every match still requires the name to be followed by \s or > (attrs or
// close), so real words that merely contain the letters (acpi/acpi.h includes,
// caption, app, uppercase ACPI) never match; a false positive costs at most
// the same bounded caps as before (swallow ≤ SWALLOW_CAP, hold ≤ HOLD_LIMIT/TAG_OPEN_CAP).
//
// ─── INVARIANT (#1039): tool-call arguments are user intent ─────────────────
// Anything the host will EXECUTE or PERSIST — tool-call arguments in every
// wire shape (openai tool_calls[].function.arguments fragments, anthropic
// input_json_delta.partial_json and tool_use.input, responses
// function_call_arguments.delta/.done and item.arguments) — is forwarded
// BYTE-EXACT. Never route it through any filter from this file, at fragment
// or whole-payload granularity, and never "clean" it because it contains a
// tag-shaped echo. A shape-based filter cannot distinguish a model-echoed
// render tag from a literal the user genuinely wants written (bash command
// strings, write/edit file contents): stripping arguments silently corrupts
// executed/persisted data (#1039). Echoed tags surfacing in a host TUI is
// cosmetic noise; that fix belongs on the injection side (host renderTags
// policy, #933), never here. The strippers below apply to model PROSE only
// (content/reasoning_content/reasoning/thinking/text/summary fields).
