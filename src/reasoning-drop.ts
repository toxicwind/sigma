 *  tool calls at request time — the sigma twin of
 *  sigma-pi #336/#339/#348, aligned with opencode-acp #377.
 *  `compress` tool messages are hard-exempt from compression (their tool
 *  results are the anchors that keep block summaries addressable), so the
 *  reasoning attached to those turns rides along EVERY forwarded request as
 *  an unreclaimable context floor — measured at ~83.5% of the never-covered
 *  residual on real long sessions, growing ~9 KB per compression round.
 *  This pass removes those reasoning messages from the OUTBOUND view only
 *  (persisted history and kernel state are never modified) once the round is
 *  closed and the reasoning run exceeds the size gate. A round is closed on
 *  ROUND EVIDENCE, not on user messages: the compress tool result must have
 *  arrived and at least one message must exist after it. The in-flight round
 *  (result still missing or still the last message) is never touched [#348
 *  twin]. */

 *     round has demonstrably moved on). No user message is required, so
 *     long agentic sessions do close rounds; a call without a result, or
 *     whose result is still the last message, is in flight and never
 *     touched;
 *  2. selector: `contentType: "tool-call"` with `toolName === "compress"`
 *     (other protected tools would need their own explicit config);
 *  3. size: the run of reasoning messages immediately preceding the call
 *     (contiguous, as emitted by anthropicToCore/openaiToCore/responsesToCore)
 *     totals strictly more than `threshold` chars.
 *  Pure: never mutates the input; idempotent; fail-safe (any error returns
