## Build Commands

```bash
npm run build          # tsup bundle (inlines acp-kernel)
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.build.json
npm test               # node --import tsx --test tests/*.test.ts
```

## Local Testing & Install

Test against the REAL published artifact:

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g billion-context@latest   # install from registry
bili start --port 8787
```

`npm install -g . --install-links` also works (installs a real copy of the local
build). The `--install-links` flag is REQUIRED on npm ≥ 9: without it, local-directory
global installs default to a SYMLINK (`install-links=false`), which leaks dev-tree
edits into the "installed" tool and silently re-links on reinstall (#1225). Verify with
`readlink $(npm root -g)/billion-context` — empty output means a real copy. The
registry install remains preferred for testing the real published artifact.

## E2E Regression (real client through bili)

`tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts` drives the **real `codex` CLI** through a built proxy
against a real Responses-compatible upstream and asserts the full context lifecycle
end-to-end: warmup → load growth → ACP compress → purity → native-compact
interception (last phase gated by `E2E_FORGE=1`). Full phase details, env vars, and
mechanics: `tests/e2e/README.md`.

```bash
# zero-token preflight (codex binary + dist + upstream reachable)
E2E_CHECK=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts

# full run (defaults to local sglang at http://127.0.0.1:8199/v1, zero cost)
npm run build
ACP_TEST_E2E=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts

# + native-compact interception phase
ACP_TEST_E2E=1 E2E_FORGE=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts
```

Rules:

- The suite **skips by default** so `npm test` stays free; never remove the
  `ACP_TEST_E2E` gate.
- Run it (at least the 4-phase core) before merging changes to the request
  pipeline — `server.ts`, `src/loop/`, adapters, preflight/compact paths. It is
  the only coverage that exercises real client behavior (codex UA, wire quirks,
  retry loops).
- Any Responses-compatible upstream works via `E2E_UPSTREAM_URL` /
  `E2E_UPSTREAM_KEY`; the provider is configured as `name = "OpenAI"` so codex
  stays on the remote compaction (V2) path — do not "fix" this.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci-e2e.yml`) auto-runs on PRs whose diff touches the
  request-pipeline hot files (`src/server.ts`, `src/server/**`, `src/loop/**`,
  `src/agent/**`, adapters/stream/persist, `tests/e2e/**`, `package-lock.json`
  — an acp-kernel pin bump IS a pipeline change) plus manual dispatch for anything
  else. It needs repo secrets `E2E_UPSTREAM_URL` / `E2E_UPSTREAM_KEY`; a hosted
  runner cannot reach `127.0.0.1` upstreams, and events without secret access
  (fork PRs) skip the run gracefully instead of failing.

## E2E: Real-Image Billing Lane (`npm run test:e2e:image`)

`tests/e2e/e2e-image-billing.test.ts` is the hermetic twin of the manual
verification that cleared PR #1857 (#1843/#1848): a corpus of structurally
real images (valid PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF containers, real dimensions, a 4.7MB
4032x3024 photo, EXIF-orientation, truncated and pure-garbage blobs) is
synthesized deterministically in pure Node — no PIL/ImageMagick, no network,
zero tokens — and driven through the real billing pipeline against a mock
upstream that bills the Qwen2-VL formula. It pins the three failure classes
#1857 fixed: header-parser truth for every container, the >=700x bytes-prior
poison ratio, and the learned-cost rescue (arbitrated 12.6MB forward ->
usage report teaches the per-image cost -> stale-high usage baseline no
longer bricks the session -> baseline regresses to real billing) plus the
default auto->pixels route riding a malformed blob. CI:
`.github/workflows/ci-image.yml` auto-runs on PRs touching the image/
window-gate surfaces; it always runs ungated (needs nothing external), ~1s.

## E2E: Hermetic Local Registry (`ACP_TEST_REGISTRY`)

`tests/e2e/e2e-registry.test.ts` brings its own verdaccio instance (random loopback
port read back from `listen(0)`, isolated storage/config/home) and exercises the REAL
self-update chain end-to-end — dist-tag resolve → tarball download → sha512 verify →
staged extract → in-place install → disk flip — plus post-update
`plugin install opencode`. Loopback only; zero external network, zero secrets,
zero tokens.

`tests/e2e/e2e-advisory-rollback.test.ts` (same gate, same fixture infra)
drives a resident `bili start` against a rollback-form advisory document and
asserts the #1588 contract end-to-end: control self-update, forced rollback
to the older target + persistent restart banner, no ping-pong across cycles
(pre-restart), and the candidate gate refusing the affected latest
(post-restart).

```bash
npm run build
ACP_TEST_REGISTRY=1 node --import tsx --test \
  tests/e2e/e2e-registry.test.ts tests/e2e/e2e-advisory-rollback.test.ts
```

Rules:

- Gated by `ACP_TEST_REGISTRY=1`; skips by default, and the `npm test` glob does
  not cover `tests/e2e/` anyway. CI job: `.github/workflows/ci-registry.yml`.
- Run it before merging changes to `src/update.ts`, `src/advisory.ts`, or the
  install/uninstall pipeline (`src/plugin-install.ts`).
- The updater's registry base URL and check interval are overridable via
  `BILI_UPDATE_REGISTRY` / `BILI_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (defaults unchanged when
  unset) — these seams exist for this suite (#1153); keep them default-invariant.
- The fixture MUST bring its own registry instance — never point it at an external
  (even internal) registry service.
